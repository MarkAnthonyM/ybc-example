# ybc Bulma docs example
This repo contains a quick run down of some functionality of the ybc crate library. The examples here try to use the various examples listed in the bulma documention as a template, following closely in order to arrive at the same end result in both look and style. Hopefully this allows for some sort of synergy between both docs. For now only Navbar functionality is explored. If deemed beneficial, the rest of the ybc library will be explored, resulting a simple website that hopefully may act as a useful refrence.
